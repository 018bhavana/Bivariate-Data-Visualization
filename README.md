# Bivariate Data Visualization (Student Alcohol Consumption Dataset)

This project focuses on **bivariate analysis** using continuous and categorical data from the [Student Alcohol Consumption dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption).

## 📌 Objectives
- Explore **categorical vs categorical**, **continuous vs continuous**, and **categorical vs continuous** relationships.
- Visualize statistical patterns and correlations in student academic performance and demographics.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, JoyPy, Statsmodels)
- Tableau (for advanced visualization)

## 📊 Visualizations Implemented
### 1. Categorical vs Categorical
- Stacked Bar Chart  
- Grouped Bar Chart  
- Segmented Bar Chart (percent-based)  
- Mosaic Plot  

### 2. Continuous vs Continuous
- Scatterplot with Regression Fit Line  

### 3. Categorical vs Continuous
- Bar Chart (Summary Statistics)  
- Grouped Kernel Density Plots  
- Box Plots  
- Violin Plots  
- Ridgeline Plots  
- Beeswarm Plots  

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle.  
2. Place `student-mat.csv` (or `student-por.csv`) in your working directory.  
3. Run the provided Jupyter Notebook `DV3.ipynb`.
